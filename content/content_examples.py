<h2><strong>Panthers vs. Hurricanes Over 5.5</strong></h2>
<strong><a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/article/author/ryan-dadoun">Ryan Dadoun</a></strong>: In Game 1, the Carolina Hurricanes and Florida Panthers showcased their dialed-in goaltenders en route to a 3-2 quadruple-overtime victory for Florida. However, because that contest went on for so long, I think goaltender fatigue will be a big factor in tonight's contest.

There’s a chance that Carolina may rest Frederik Andersen and start Antti Raanta, but Panthers coach Paul Maurice has already committed to starting Sergei Bobrovsky on Saturday, per <a href="https://twitter.com/TomGulittiNHL/status/1659616618941480961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Gulitti of NHL.com</a>. As good as Bobrovsky has been lately, that’s a lot to ask of the 34-year-old after he spent 139:47 in net Thursday.

If the Canes start Raanta, they’ll at least have a fresh goaltender, but rust would be a concern given that he last played on April 25, so their situation will also be far from ideal.

Additionally, these two offenses are solid, having combined for 6.81 goals per game in the playoffs. With the goaltenders potentially running on fumes, those skilled skaters can make this a significantly different-looking contest than Game 1.
<h4><mark>The Pick: Panthers vs. Hurricanes over 5.5 goals (-115 at <a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/online-sports-betting/reviews/betrivers">BetRivers</a>)</mark></h4>

<h2><strong>Sam Reinhart Over 2.5 Shots (+140)</strong></h2>
<strong><a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/article/author/greg-liodice">Greg Liodice</a></strong>: Part of what has made the Florida Panthers so special in these playoffs is their depth. They’re so deep that they have 30-goal scorer Sam Reinhart on the third line. Reinhart has had a really good playoffs with six goals in 13 games, including an overtime winner in game three against Toronto.

What makes Reinhart a threat is his ability on the power play. Both of his power-play points were goals, and he’s the perfect player in the slot. However, the Carolina Hurricanes' penalty kill is the best in the playoffs. It could pose a problem for Florida’s power play since the Canes do an exceptional job keeping the puck on the outside.

Reinhart has averaged 2.3 shots per game and has reached over 2.5 shots five times this postseason. I see no reason why he won’t be able to do it again.

Of course, you can look at Thursday night’s endless game and see that he registered only two shots in 40 minutes. Carolina did a superb job at limiting Reinhart’s chances, but I think he’s poised for a bigger game. His PDO is slightly above the 1.000 mark, which means his luck runs hot and cold. He’s also seventh on the team in scoring chances.

While it may be a risk backing Reinhart to generate shots, the potential payout could be beneficial.

<h2><strong>Matthew Tkachuk Under 0.5 Points (+230)</strong></h2>
<strong><a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/article/author/nicholas-martin">Nicholas Martin</a></strong>: Yes, it is difficult to make the case for this prop after Matthew Tkachuk came through with the 4OT winner in Game 1 of the series. Thinking about it logically, though, that was one point in eight periods of play versus the Canes.

I would say that is still a good thing considering the lofty price for this bet.

Tkachuk's offensive play has tailed off slightly since the start of the postseason. He has put up just three points in the last five games. He, Sam Bennett and Nick Cousins were not overly threatening at five-on-five in Game 1. Florida's projected team total in this game is also relatively low.

It might not be a ton of fun to sweat out, but I think this number is just giving a little bit too much respect to Tkachuk in a spot versus an elite defensive team.
<h4><mark>The Pick: Matthew Tkachuk under 0.5 points (+230 at BetRivers)</mark></h4>

<h2><strong>Jordan Martinook Anytime Goalscorer (+430)
</strong></h2>
<strong><a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/article/author/grant-white">Grant White</a></strong>: Depth scoring has been the Carolina Hurricanes' biggest asset this postseason, and they'll have to tap into that in Game 2 against the Florida Panthers. Carolina has a breadth of scoring options the team can turn to, but no one has been more reliable than Jordan Martinook this postseason.

Martinook has been one of the most productive Canes skaters in the playoffs. The former second-round pick leads the forwards' corps in on-ice scoring and high-danger chances, averaging 9.0 and 4.3 per game.

Further, he's been a high-volume shooter for the Hurricanes, ranking third on the team in shots on goal and recording multiple shots in five straight.

More importantly, we've seen a recent surge in Martinook's output. The winger has goals in three of his past five, with all 10 of his points coming over the past six games. After getting skunked on a five-shot effort last time out, we like Martinook to bounce back with another solid effort on Saturday night.

You could play it safe and back the over on Martinook's points prop, but at +430, we like him as an anytime goalscorer.

One quick glance at Braxton Garrett's numbers will tell you that he has not gotten off to a great start in 2023. However, the strikeouts have been flowing in his better outings, and he has another great matchup ahead of him.

Garrett gets to face the San Francisco Giants this afternoon. The Giants come in with the third-highest strikeout rate in the Majors. While they're in third, it's important to note that they're just .02 percent away from having the highest strikeout rate in all of baseball.

When Garrett is on, he tends to rack up strikeouts, and he's gone over this total in four of his seven starts this season. What he's done this year adds to a long trend of success, as he's gone over this number in 56% of his previous 25 starts.

With implied odds of -127 and our Action Labs projections having him pegged for 5.3 strikeouts, this is a strong angle to back.

<strong>Pick: Garrett Over 4.5 Strikeouts</strong>

Patrick Sandoval was a breakout stud last season. While his 2023 campaign has started with solid numbers, he's not quite the same pitcher, and it's impacted his ability to go deep into games.

Sandoval's strikeout rate is down significantly, sitting over 7% lower than in 2022. Although his command has been similar, his inability to miss bats has led to many hits.

Tonight, he'll face a Twins lineup that has shown they can be all or nothing. Minnesota leads the Majors in strikeout rate, but they have power littered throughout the lineup.

Sandoval's xERA points to sizable regression, and the Twins are the team that can knock him around.

Odds are his outing will be short tonight, and history backs it up. Over this last 35 starts, he has gone under this total in 74% of them.

Those implied odds of -288 give tremendous value to this price.

<strong>Pick: Sandoval Under 18.5 Outs </strong>

Joe Musgrove has been sensational since dawning the mustard and brown, but a toe injury gave him a late start to this season, and he has yet to fully return to form.

His 6.63 ERA and 1.63 WHIP through his first four starts are unsightly, but the strikeouts have been there for the Padres right-hander.

Tonight, he'll face a Red Sox team that doesn't strike out all that often, but the edge isn't in the matchup. This total is far too low for Musgrove, as we should expect him to positively regress.

As Musgrove returns to form, solid strikeout totals will come along with that. He's gone over this total 69.6% of the time over his last 69 starts.

That gives us implied odds of -228. Back Musgrove to bounce back tonight.

His 6.63 ERA and 1.63 WHIP through his first four starts are unsightly, but the strikeouts have been there for the Padres right-hander.

Tonight, he'll face a Red Sox team that doesn't strike out all that often, but the edge isn't in the matchup. This total is far too low for Musgrove, as we should expect him to positively regress.

As Musgrove returns to form, solid strikeout totals will come along with that. He's gone over this total 69.6% of the time over his last 69 starts.

That gives us implied odds of -228. Back Musgrove to bounce back tonight.

<strong>Pick: Musgrove Over 4.5 Strikeouts </strong>
