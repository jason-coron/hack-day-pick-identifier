The 2022-23 NHL postseason rolls on with tonight's Florida Panthers vs. Carolina Hurricanes game (8 p.m., TNT). The Panthers won the teams' quadruple-overtime nail-biter on Thursday.

Below, check out our hockey crew's top picks, including a game <a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/education/over-under-total">total</a> and some player prop picks, for the second game in the Eastern Conference Finals.

<h2><strong>Panthers vs. Hurricanes Over 5.5</strong></h2>
<strong><a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/article/author/ryan-dadoun">Ryan Dadoun</a></strong>: In Game 1, the Carolina Hurricanes and Florida Panthers showcased their dialed-in goaltenders en route to a 3-2 quadruple-overtime victory for Florida. However, because that contest went on for so long, I think goaltender fatigue will be a big factor in tonight's contest.

There’s a chance that Carolina may rest Frederik Andersen and start Antti Raanta, but Panthers coach Paul Maurice has already committed to starting Sergei Bobrovsky on Saturday, per <a href="https://twitter.com/TomGulittiNHL/status/1659616618941480961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Gulitti of NHL.com</a>. As good as Bobrovsky has been lately, that’s a lot to ask of the 34-year-old after he spent 139:47 in net Thursday.

If the Canes start Raanta, they’ll at least have a fresh goaltender, but rust would be a concern given that he last played on April 25, so their situation will also be far from ideal.

Additionally, these two offenses are solid, having combined for 6.81 goals per game in the playoffs. With the goaltenders potentially running on fumes, those skilled skaters can make this a significantly different-looking contest than Game 1.
<h4><mark>The Pick: Panthers vs. Hurricanes over 5.5 goals (-115 at <a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/online-sports-betting/reviews/betrivers">BetRivers</a>)</mark></h4>

<h2><strong>Sam Reinhart Over 2.5 Shots (+140)</strong></h2>
<strong><a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/article/author/greg-liodice">Greg Liodice</a></strong>: Part of what has made the Florida Panthers so special in these playoffs is their depth. They’re so deep that they have 30-goal scorer Sam Reinhart on the third line. Reinhart has had a really good playoffs with six goals in 13 games, including an overtime winner in game three against Toronto.

What makes Reinhart a threat is his ability on the power play. Both of his power-play points were goals, and he’s the perfect player in the slot. However, the Carolina Hurricanes' penalty kill is the best in the playoffs. It could pose a problem for Florida’s power play since the Canes do an exceptional job keeping the puck on the outside.

Reinhart has averaged 2.3 shots per game and has reached over 2.5 shots five times this postseason. I see no reason why he won’t be able to do it again.

Of course, you can look at Thursday night’s endless game and see that he registered only two shots in 40 minutes. Carolina did a superb job at limiting Reinhart’s chances, but I think he’s poised for a bigger game. His PDO is slightly above the 1.000 mark, which means his luck runs hot and cold. He’s also seventh on the team in scoring chances.

While it may be a risk backing Reinhart to generate shots, the potential payout could be beneficial.

<h2><strong>Matthew Tkachuk Under 0.5 Points (+230)</strong></h2>
<strong><a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/article/author/nicholas-martin">Nicholas Martin</a></strong>: Yes, it is difficult to make the case for this prop after Matthew Tkachuk came through with the 4OT winner in Game 1 of the series. Thinking about it logically, though, that was one point in eight periods of play versus the Canes.

I would say that is still a good thing considering the lofty price for this bet.

Tkachuk's offensive play has tailed off slightly since the start of the postseason. He has put up just three points in the last five games. He, Sam Bennett and Nick Cousins were not overly threatening at five-on-five in Game 1. Florida's projected team total in this game is also relatively low.

It might not be a ton of fun to sweat out, but I think this number is just giving a little bit too much respect to Tkachuk in a spot versus an elite defensive team.
<h4><mark>The Pick: Matthew Tkachuk under 0.5 points (+230 at BetRivers)</mark></h4>

<h2><strong>Jordan Martinook Anytime Goalscorer (+430)
</strong></h2>
<strong><a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/article/author/grant-white">Grant White</a></strong>: Depth scoring has been the Carolina Hurricanes' biggest asset this postseason, and they'll have to tap into that in Game 2 against the Florida Panthers. Carolina has a breadth of scoring options the team can turn to, but no one has been more reliable than Jordan Martinook this postseason.

Martinook has been one of the most productive Canes skaters in the playoffs. The former second-round pick leads the forwards' corps in on-ice scoring and high-danger chances, averaging 9.0 and 4.3 per game.

Further, he's been a high-volume shooter for the Hurricanes, ranking third on the team in shots on goal and recording multiple shots in five straight.

More importantly, we've seen a recent surge in Martinook's output. The winger has goals in three of his past five, with all 10 of his points coming over the past six games. After getting skunked on a five-shot effort last time out, we like Martinook to bounce back with another solid effort on Saturday night.

You could play it safe and back the over on Martinook's points prop, but at +430, we like him as an anytime goalscorer.

One quick glance at Braxton Garrett's numbers will tell you that he has not gotten off to a great start in 2023. However, the strikeouts have been flowing in his better outings, and he has another great matchup ahead of him.

Garrett gets to face the San Francisco Giants this afternoon. The Giants come in with the third-highest strikeout rate in the Majors. While they're in third, it's important to note that they're just .02 percent away from having the highest strikeout rate in all of baseball.

When Garrett is on, he tends to rack up strikeouts, and he's gone over this total in four of his seven starts this season. What he's done this year adds to a long trend of success, as he's gone over this number in 56% of his previous 25 starts.

With implied odds of -127 and our Action Labs projections having him pegged for 5.3 strikeouts, this is a strong angle to back.

<strong>Pick: Garrett Over 4.5 Strikeouts</strong>

Patrick Sandoval was a breakout stud last season. While his 2023 campaign has started with solid numbers, he's not quite the same pitcher, and it's impacted his ability to go deep into games.

Sandoval's strikeout rate is down significantly, sitting over 7% lower than in 2022. Although his command has been similar, his inability to miss bats has led to many hits.

Tonight, he'll face a Twins lineup that has shown they can be all or nothing. Minnesota leads the Majors in strikeout rate, but they have power littered throughout the lineup.

Sandoval's xERA points to sizable regression, and the Twins are the team that can knock him around.

Odds are his outing will be short tonight, and history backs it up. Over this last 35 starts, he has gone under this total in 74% of them.

Those implied odds of -288 give tremendous value to this price.

<strong>Pick: Sandoval Under 18.5 Outs </strong>

Joe Musgrove has been sensational since dawning the mustard and brown, but a toe injury gave him a late start to this season, and he has yet to fully return to form.

His 6.63 ERA and 1.63 WHIP through his first four starts are unsightly, but the strikeouts have been there for the Padres right-hander.

Tonight, he'll face a Red Sox team that doesn't strike out all that often, but the edge isn't in the matchup. This total is far too low for Musgrove, as we should expect him to positively regress.

As Musgrove returns to form, solid strikeout totals will come along with that. He's gone over this total 69.6% of the time over his last 69 starts.

That gives us implied odds of -228. Back Musgrove to bounce back tonight.

Bruce Brown has been fantastic off the bench for the Nuggets during their playoff run. He's averaging 12.5 points per game on 52.6% shooting from the field.

However, most of his scoring production comes at home, where he can use his speed to his advantage. Brown is averaging 10.4 points per game on the road this postseason compared to 13.8 per game at home. He's also shooting 25% from behind the arc in his five road playoff games.

Brown had similar splits during the regular season. Not only does he struggle on the road, but so do the Nuggets as a team. Including the playoffs, the Nuggets are 21-25 on the road compared to 42-7 at home.

That's a big reason why the Lakers are such heavy home favorites tonight.

The Lakers also boast the third-best defensive rating (<a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?dir=A&amp;sort=DEF_RATING" target="_blank" rel="noopener">108.4</a>) during the playoffs, as they've found their identity. They're allowing just 99.3 points per game at home in the postseason.

This is the best prop in our <a href="https://labs.actionnetwork.com/props-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActionLabs Prop Model</a>, as Brown is projected to score only 8.7 points tonight. Getting this value at even-money on FanDuel is a steal.

Brown has been barking at several Lakers players, and we saw how that worked out for Dillon Brooks after Game 2 of L.A.'s series against Memphis.

Brown has had a successful postseason thus far, but there are plenty of reasons to believe he may struggle to reach 12 points tonight.

Another player prop coming in at even-money is Austin Reaves over 4.5 assists at DraftKings.

Reaves is third on the Lakers behind LeBron James and Anthony Davis in minutes per game during the postseason, becoming their third option on many occasions. He's averaging 7.9 potential assists and 4.6 actual assists per game while accumulating five or more assists in each of his last four games. That gives us awesome value on this prop.

One of the top assist leaders on the Lakers has been D'Angelo Russell, but he's slowly playing his way out of this series with a -41 mark in 59 minutes. The Lakers are +30 in 37 minutes without Russell through the first two games against the Nuggets. If Russell doesn't start or gets his playing time cut, that's going to boost the passing production from Reaves.

Our <a href="https://labs.actionnetwork.com/props-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prop Model</a> has Reaves projected to accumulate 5.7 assists tonight, which is well over his 4.5 prop line.

The Nuggets' defensive rating drops from 107.5 at home to 116.2 on the road during the playoffs. They're a different team away from home, which will also benefit Reaves. The Nuggets are allowing 115 points per game on the road compared to 103 at home.

The Lakers are implied for 114.25 points as six-point home favorites. Reaves will have plenty of opportunity to reach this over prop, and I would even consider climbing the ladder if Russell doesn't start.

example_04 = """In the aftermath of a heartbreaking Game 1 loss on Tuesday night, the Lakers appeared to have their sights set on tying this series at 1-1 in the early goings of Thursday’s contest, as LeBron James and co. went to the midway break of Game 2 leading Denver by a score of 53-48, but out of nowhere, Jamal Murray caught fire and erupted for 27 points on 8-of-11 shooting in the second half for the Nuggets, and Denver managed to escape with a second straight victory, as well as a 2-0 series lead.

The Nuggets did everything in their power to give away Game 2. Nikola Jokic scored just 23 points on 9-of-21 field goal attempts, and as a team, they shot just 43% from the field. Denver also shot eight less free throw attempts than the Lakers, and turned the ball over three more times in the contest.

However, none of Denver’s shortcomings moved the needle enough to overshadow L. A.’s abysmal shooting performance. Anthony Davis was the standout underperformer. He scored just 18 points on 4-of-15 shot attempts, which to a certain extent, was indicative of how the Lakers played as a team in Game 2, considering they posted combined clips of 44% from the field and 27% from three-point range in the loss.

LeBron James and D’Angelo Russell certainly didn’t bring their A-Game in Game 2 either. LeBron scored just 22 points and clunked all six of his three-point attempts, while Russell scored just 10 points and made 1-of-5 long-range attempts.

Truth be told, the only members of the Lakers that truly brought their best stuff in Game 2 was Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura, who combined for 43 points on 59% from the field and 60% from three-point in the loss.

However, with all of that factored into the equation, the Lakers still turned the second matchup of this series into a highly competitive battle down the stretch, and ultimately, managed to get the backdoor cover in a second straight defeat (LAL +5.5). 

A backdoor cover won’t be an option this time around, though. The tables have been turned in Game 3. The Lakers are currently tagged as rather generous 5.5-point favorites in Saturday’s contest, which is the exact number that Denver was favored by in Game 2.

Some bettors may find it somewhat surprising that the Nuggets are tagged as such steep underdogs in Saturday’s contest, despite already boasting a 2-0 series lead. However, don’t take the bait. Those that have followed this Denver’ team throughout the year fully understand why the spread for this one has jumped to the opposite side of the spectrum ahead of Game 3.

The Nuggets very well might be the best team in basketball on their home floor. They went 34-7 at home during the regular season, and they’ve posted a perfect record of 8-0 at home in the playoffs, which to no surprise, is where the first two matchups of this series took place.

But on the other side of that same coin, the Nuggets are a completely different team when forced to play away from their home arena.  They went 19-22 on the road during the regular season, and they’re just 2-3 in their five road playoffs games thus far.

Good teams win at home. Great teams win on the road. And for the time being, Denver still qualifies as a good team, not a great one. Lay the points with L. A. in Game 3.

Score Prediction: Lakers 118, Nuggets 109
Best Bet: Lakers -5.5 (-110)"""
